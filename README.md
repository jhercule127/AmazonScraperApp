<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project was a beginner/intermediate project that I took on personally to learn about web scraping and a bit about JavaScript. I figured one of the best ways would be scraping a website that I often visit - Amazon.com. I found many blockers that such as User-Agents, but ultimately the application functioned properly as expected.

The web application takes two inputs:
* Your budget you have to spend
* List of URLs of Amazon products you wish to purchase

Of course, some products are more diffficult to parse so at the moment only 'In stock' prodcucts can be scraped and only ones bought in US Dollars. After crawling and getting the necessary information the web app will output the results of the products you can purchase and how much you are left with. An extra feature that I will looking to add is setting a reminder (given certain settings) to notify someone when a low price is found.

Obsviously, the extra feature would not be bombarding someone with hundreds of emails, but instead will run temporarily to at a set interval.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
